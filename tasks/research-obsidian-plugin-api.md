# Research Obsidian Plugin API

## Requirements

Investigate the Obsidian plugin API to understand how Agent Station
could integrate with Obsidian as a plugin in the future. Focus on:

- How plugins read and write vault files
- How plugins can add custom views (e.g., a task board)
- How plugins hook into file change events

## Verification

- [ ] Research notes cover all three focus areas
- [ ] Notes include links to relevant Obsidian documentation
- [ ] Findings include a recommendation on feasibility
